# Create a micro:bit stopwatch which displays the number
# of seconds that you hold down one of the micro:bit buttons.

# You may wish to accomplish this using a while loop that
# checks whether the button is being pressed. When it is,
# you can update the time elapsed and when it is not, you
# can display that time.

# You will want to make use of the microbit function called
# microbit.running_time() which has a return value of the
# number of milliseconds since the microbit started running.

# You will need to add some while loops and other code in
# order to turn this into a stopwatch that times how long
# the button is held down for.

import microbit

time0 = microbit.running_time() #get the current running time

microbit.sleep(1500) #wait 1.5 seconds

time1 = microbit.running_time() #get the current running time

elapsed_time = time1 - time0 #calculates difference in milliseconds
print(elapsed_time, " milliseconds")
